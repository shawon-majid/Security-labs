# Encryption & Hashing using OpenSSL

Here I will perform symmetric encryption and hashing utilising one of the most widely used crypto tools called `Openssl`. It is widely used in Internet web servers, serving a majority
of all web sites. OpenSSL contains an open-source implementation of the **SSL** and **TLS** protocols. The core library, written in the C programming language, implements basic cryptographic functions and provides various utility functions. Wrappers allowing the use of the OpenSSL library in a variety of computer languages are available.

First of all, we need a hex editor, one of the common choice for Unix OS is to use ghex. To install ghex on MacOS,

```bash
brew install ghex
```

considering [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is already installed.

Now, we need openssl to get the utility functions. Generally openssl is builtin in any unix operating system. To check if openssl is working just command.

```bash
openssl
```

The given tasks are provided in separte folders. And the documentation of each tasks are given on a Markdown file in each respective directory. For running the commands, Change your directory to each folder and start
