Its raining in sRœlàƒJuòüàØòmphere is awesoe, I am remembering the day of return from Dhaka in 2017. I went there for enjoying my vacation after SSC. It was hot like an oven there in dhaka. When I came back to sylhet, It felt like diving in the cold water during the scorching heat of sun. It felt magical to land in sylhet from dhaka.
